# Predicting College Basketball Success

This repo contains code and output for my paper about which team statistics are the best predictors of success in Men's College Basketball. A dataset from sports-reference.com containing information about the statistics of each NCAA Division 1 Men's School basketball team over the past 5 seasons was analyzed and discussed in the paper.

It is organised as follows:\
-scripts contains and r script used for data cleaning \
-inputs holds the datasets used and analyzed in the paper, as well as a datasheet \
-outputs contains an rmd file with code, a pdf of the final paper, and a bibliography for references
