# Paper On NCAAB Stats

This repo contains code and output for my paper about which team statistics are the most important in Men's College Basketball. A dataset from sports-reference.com containing information about the statistics of each NCAA Division 1 Men's School basketball team in the 2021-22 season was analyzed and discussed in the paper.

It is organised as follows:\n
-scripts contains r scripts used for data downloading and cleaning \n
-inputs holds the datasets used and analyzed in the paper \n
-outputs contains an rmd file with code, a pdf of the final paper, and a bibliography for references\n
